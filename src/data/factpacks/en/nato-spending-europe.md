## What They Are Saying

Politicians — particularly in the United States — frequently claim that European NATO members "refuse to pay their fair share" for defence, that America is "paying for Europe's security," and that allies are freeloading. This framing suggests a deliberate refusal by wealthy nations to honour a clear obligation.

**Frustration about unequal burden-sharing is legitimate.** The United States does spend significantly more on defence than any other NATO member, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP. That imbalance is real and worth discussing.

But describing it as a "refusal to pay" misrepresents what the commitment actually is and ignores what has been happening over the past decade.

## What The Documents Show

### What the 2% Target Actually Is

At the 2014 Wales Summit, NATO members agreed to "aim to move towards" spending 2% of GDP on defence within a decade (by 2024). Key facts about this pledge:

| Aspect | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Legal status | Non-binding political commitment |
| Timeline | 10 years (2014-2024) |
| Language | "aim to move towards" — not "must reach" |
| Context | Adopted after Russia's annexation of Crimea |

This was not a bill, a treaty, or a mandatory payment. No country "owes" NATO money. Each nation funds its own military; NATO has a modest shared budget (about 3.3 billion EUR) that all members contribute to.

### The Trend: Steady Increases

NATO's own expenditure report shows the trajectory:

| Year | Members meeting 2% | Direction |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| 2014 | 3 of 28 | Starting point |
| 2017 | 5 of 29 | Increasing |
| 2020 | 9 of 30 | Increasing |
| 2022 | 7 of 30 | Slight dip |
| 2023 | 11 of 31 | Increasing |
| 2024 | 23 of 32 | Significant jump |

From 3 members meeting the target in 2014 to 23 in 2024 — that is not "refusal." That is a decade-long trend of increasing investment that accelerated sharply after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

### What Gets Left Out

The "refusal to pay" framing omits several key facts:

1. **The 2% was a goal, not a deadline.** The pledge said "aim to move towards" — explicitly acknowledging it would take time.
2. **Spending has increased dramatically.** European NATO allies increased defence spending by over 30% between 2014 and 2024 in real terms.
3. **The US spends more by choice.** American defence spending funds global force projection, not just European security. The US has military bases in over 70 countries and maintains capabilities that serve American strategic interests worldwide.
4. **Non-financial contributions matter.** Some allies contribute significant capabilities relative to size: intelligence sharing, strategic geography, specialised forces, logistics infrastructure.

### The Manipulation Tactic

The framing works by:

1. Presenting a non-binding aspiration as a mandatory obligation
2. Ignoring the significant upward trend in spending
3. Conflating total US defence spending (which serves global interests) with spending "for" Europe
4. Using the word "refuse" to imply bad faith where the reality is gradual compliance

**This tactic is effective regardless of your views on NATO.** Whether you think European defence spending should be higher or lower, using inaccurate framing manipulates your conclusion.

### The Bottom Line

European NATO spending has increased substantially over the past decade. By 2024, 23 of 32 members met or approached the 2% target — up from just 3 in 2014. The claim that allies "refuse to pay" omits the non-binding nature of the pledge, the clear upward trend, and the broader context of what US defence spending actually funds.

**NATO publishes the expenditure data every year. SIPRI provides independent verification. The numbers are public. Check them.**
