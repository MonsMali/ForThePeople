title: "Are Republicans tougher on Bad Bunny's Super Bowl show than on enforcing the Epstein files law?"
translationKey: "gop-bad-bunny-vs-epstein-files"
summary: "Some Republicans are demanding investigations and penalties over Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show, while the same party has slowed efforts to enforce the law requiring release of the Epstein files."
claim: "Republicans are pushing harder to punish Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show than to enforce the law that orders release of the Jeffrey Epstein files."
verdict: "missing-context"
verdictSummary: "Republicans in Congress did vote overwhelmingly for, and President Trump signed, a law to release the Epstein files. But some of the same Republican leaders have since blocked or delayed Senate moves to enforce that law, even as Republican lawmakers call for investigations and penalties over Bad Bunny's halftime show. The contrast is real, yet it overlooks the earlier bipartisan support for the Epstein transparency law and the role of the Justice Department in slow-walking disclosure."

## What They Are Saying

On social media and in commentary, critics claim that Republicans are "more outraged" about Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show than about holding powerful people in the Epstein files accountable. They argue that GOP politicians are demanding punishment for a music performance while refusing to enforce a law that would expose alleged abusers linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The shorthand version of this claim is that Republicans want to "go after Bad Bunny" but "protect Epstein's friends."

Several Republican lawmakers have publicly attacked Bad Bunny's 2026 halftime show, calling it "illegal," "pure smut," and "flagrant, indecent" material that should trigger federal sanctions. At the same time, critics point to Senate Republicans' past moves to block or slow efforts to enforce the Epstein Files Transparency Act, despite voting for the bill when it passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.

## What The Documents Show

### The Epstein Files Law: Bipartisan Origins

In July 2025, the House passed H.R. 4405, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, by a vote of 427–1, with Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana the only "no" vote. The bill requires the US Department of Justice to review and release Jeffrey Epstein–related records, with redactions to protect victims, within set deadlines; the Senate approved a similar measure by unanimous consent, and President Donald Trump signed it into law in November 2025. News reports and the statute's text describe the law as a rare moment of broad bipartisan agreement on transparency, with Republicans and Democrats alike voting to force disclosure.

### Enforcement Stalls in the Senate

After the law took effect, the Justice Department missed deadlines and released only a fraction of the estimated millions of pages of Epstein records, prompting new clashes in Congress. In September 2025, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tried to attach an amendment that would have strengthened enforcement and allowed Congress to sue to compel release, but Senate Republicans blocked the move, denying unanimous consent and preventing a quick vote. A later Senate debate, recorded in the Congressional Record in February 2026, shows Democrats again pushing for stronger enforcement tools while several Republicans warned about "weaponising" litigation and resisted additional legal pressure on the Trump administration to accelerate disclosure.

### The Bad Bunny Response

On the cultural front, Republicans have mounted an organised response to Bad Bunny's Super Bowl appearance. AP and other outlets describe the halftime show as a celebration of Latino culture that quickly became a political flashpoint, with conservative commentators and some GOP politicians denouncing the performance as un-American and indecent. A group of House Republicans led by Rep. Andy Ogles sent a formal letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) alleging that the show violated federal obscenity or indecency rules and demanding a full investigation into NBC and the NFL, including potential fines and other sanctions.

In that letter and subsequent interviews, Ogles classified the performance as "pure smut" and "unspeakable depravities," urging the House Energy and Commerce Committee to open a parallel congressional probe into the league and the network. Separate reporting on Florida Republicans, including Rep. Randy Fine, shows calls for the FCC to use its "maximum penalties" and even consider revoking broadcast licences if regulators find violations — language that goes well beyond a simple request for a review. Local and fact-check coverage confirms that, while no one has formally introduced a bill to "arrest" Bad Bunny, multiple GOP lawmakers have framed the show as potentially illegal and have pressed for regulatory punishment.

### The Contrast

By contrast, there is no comparable sustained Republican campaign to punish officials for missing Epstein files deadlines. Republicans were part of the coalition that passed and signed the Epstein files law, but in the Senate, some of the same party's leaders used procedural tools to stop stronger enforcement measures, citing concerns about litigation and separation of powers. Democrats and transparency advocates argue that this has effectively shielded the Justice Department — and, indirectly, well-connected figures named in the files — from the full force of the disclosure law.

The criticism that Republicans are "tougher on Bad Bunny than on enforcing the Epstein files law" is directionally fair: a group of lawmakers is pressing regulators and Congress to act swiftly against a television performance, while party leaders in the Senate have used their power to limit the tools available to enforce the transparency statute. However, the most absolute version of this claim omits two important facts: Republicans voted overwhelmingly for the law that mandates Epstein file disclosure, and the delays stem from both Senate procedural blocks and executive-branch inaction at the Justice Department, not a single unified decision to "protect" anyone named in the files.
