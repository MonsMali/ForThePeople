## What They Are Saying

Several Portuguese politicians, particularly from populist parties, have claimed that crime in Portugal has "doubled" or "skyrocketed" as a direct result of increased immigration. These claims intensified during the 2024-2025 political cycle and are frequently shared on social media.

**Concern about public safety is legitimate.** Everyone wants to live in a safe community, and questioning whether policy changes affect crime rates is a reasonable thing to do.

But the question deserves an honest answer based on actual crime data — not campaign slogans.

## What The Documents Show

### The Official Crime Statistics

The RASI (Relatório Anual de Segurança Interna) is Portugal's official annual internal security report, compiled by law enforcement agencies. The data shows:

| Year | Total Recorded Crimes | Change |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| 2019 | 335,067 | baseline |
| 2020 | 298,457 | -10.9% (COVID) |
| 2021 | 300,886 | +0.8% |
| 2022 | 319,025 | +6.0% |
| 2023 | 312,877 | -1.9% |
| 2024 | 294,741 | -5.8% |

Overall trend 2019-2024: **-12.0%**

During this same period, the foreign resident population in Portugal increased from approximately 590,000 to over 1,000,000.

### The Disconnect

Crime decreased while immigration increased. These two facts cannot both be true *and* support the claim that immigration caused crime to double.

Some politicians point to specific crime categories (such as robbery in Lisbon) that saw temporary increases. This is a common **cherry-picking tactic**:

1. Take one subcategory that went up
2. Ignore the overall trend that went down
3. Attribute the subcategory to immigration without evidence
4. Present it as the whole picture

### What About Per-Capita Rates?

Even when adjusted for population growth (including immigration), the per-capita crime rate in Portugal decreased. More people, less crime per person.

### The Bottom Line

Portugal's overall crime rate decreased by 12% between 2019 and 2024, a period of significant immigration growth. The claim that crime "doubled due to immigration" is contradicted by the government's own security report.

**The RASI is a public document. PORDATA publishes the time series. The data is there for anyone to check.**
