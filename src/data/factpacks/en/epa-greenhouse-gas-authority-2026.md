## What They Are Saying

On February 12, 2026, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency was revoking the 2009 endangerment finding — the scientific determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare. Zeldin called it "the Holy Grail of federal regulatory overreach" and said the finding exceeded the agency's statutory authority.

The White House reinforced this position. President Trump declared the endangerment finding "has nothing to do with public health" and described it as "a giant fraud." Several Republican members of Congress, including Senator John Cornyn and Representative Michael Cloud, praised the move. Cloud argued that the EPA had improperly treated carbon dioxide as a pollutant when it is, in his words, "plant food."

The legal justification presented by the administration is that the Clean Air Act does not grant the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants.

## What The Documents Show

The U.S. Supreme Court addressed this exact question in 2007. In **Massachusetts v. EPA**, the Court ruled 5-4 that the Environmental Protection Agency does have authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, examined Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, which requires the EPA Administrator to regulate "any air pollutant" from motor vehicles that "may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare." The Act defines "air pollutant" as "any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air."

The Court's conclusion was direct: "Because greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean Air Act's capacious definition of 'air pollutant,' EPA has the statutory authority to regulate the emission of such gases from new motor vehicles." The decision emphasized that the definition "embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe" and that "carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are undoubtedly 'physical [and] chemical... substance[s].'"

The Court rejected the EPA's argument that it lacked authority. It held that the agency could only avoid regulating if it determined that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change, or if it provided "some reasonable explanation for why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion." Policy concerns about presidential priorities or international negotiations, the Court ruled, "have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change."

| Legal Question | Supreme Court (2007) | Trump EPA (2026) |
|---|---|---|
| Are greenhouse gases "air pollutants" under the Clean Air Act? | Yes, by statutory definition | No |
| Does the EPA have authority to regulate them? | Yes, mandatory if endangerment is found | No authority exists |
| Can the EPA refuse on policy grounds? | No, must be a scientific judgment | Yes (policy priorities cited) |

Following the Supreme Court ruling, the EPA issued the endangerment finding in December 2009 after reviewing over 380,000 public comments and extensive scientific evidence. It concluded that greenhouse gases "endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations."

A Congressional Research Service analysis from June 2025 confirmed that Massachusetts v. EPA remains binding precedent. The analysis noted that courts have "consistently rejected challenges to the endangerment" since 2007, including a 2023 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

The Trump administration did not identify any subsequent Supreme Court decision that overturns Massachusetts v. EPA. While the 2022 case West Virginia v. EPA limited the EPA's regulatory options for power plants, legal experts note it did not question the EPA's underlying authority to regulate greenhouse gases — it addressed only the specific regulatory mechanism the EPA had chosen.

The administration's revocation rests on a reinterpretation of the same statutory language the Supreme Court already examined. Zeldin's February 12 announcement cites no new legislation from Congress removing the EPA's authority, nor any court ruling overturning Massachusetts v. EPA. The Supreme Court decision, the text of the Clean Air Act, and subsequent court rulings remain publicly accessible. The statutory definition of "air pollutant" has not been amended by Congress since the 2007 decision.
