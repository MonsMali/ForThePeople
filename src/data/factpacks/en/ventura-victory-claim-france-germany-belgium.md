## What They Are Saying

During a televised debate with António José Seguro ahead of the second round of the 2026 presidential election, André Ventura argued that unchecked immigration in countries like France, Germany, and Belgium explained his strong performance with Portuguese emigrants. "Perhaps that's why I won the elections in those countries with 40%," he said, "because they know what cannot happen here, which is what happened there."

## What The Documents Show

### Country-Level Results

Official data from the Secretaria-Geral do Ministério da Administração Interna (SGMAI) for the first round (18 January 2026) tells a different story for two of the three countries named.

| Country | Ventura | Seguro | Winner |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| France | 60.46% | — | Ventura |
| Germany | 22.25% | 36.16% | Seguro |
| Belgium | 19.61% | 38.93% | Seguro |

Ventura did win decisively among Portuguese emigrants in France. In Germany and Belgium — both explicitly named in his claim — he did not win. Seguro led in both countries by a wide margin.

### The 40% Figure

Ventura's 40% figure corresponds to his aggregate result across all European emigrant voters (40.98%), where he led the field. He won in five countries total: Andorra, France, Luxembourg, Serbia, and Switzerland. The claim that he "won" all three named countries with 40% conflates this regional aggregate with individual country results.

### What Is Verified

The SGMAI data is publicly accessible and links directly to results broken down by country and consulate. Ventura's strong showing among Portuguese emigrants in Europe is real — he did lead the European aggregate. The specific claim he made about winning in France, Germany, and Belgium with 40% is not supported by the official results.
