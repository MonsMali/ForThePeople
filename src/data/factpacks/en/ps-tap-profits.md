## What They Said

Pedro Nuno Santos, the leader of Portugal's Socialist Party (PS), has repeatedly used TAP Air Portugal's positive 2023 results as a political banner, arguing that his management saved the airline and proved the state can run companies effectively.

This is a major talking point in Portuguese politics because TAP — the national flag carrier — was renationalized during the pandemic and became one of the most expensive bailouts in the country's history.

## What The Documents Show

The claim is **technically true, but financially misleading**.

### The Profit Is Real

TAP did post record profits in 2023. This is an accounting fact, confirmed in their annual report. After years of losses, the airline returned to profitability.

### The Hidden Cost

To reach that profit, the Portuguese state injected **3.2 billion euros** in taxpayer money:

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| State aid approved by the European Commission | ~3.2 billion euros |
| TAP's 2023 net profit | ~200 million euros |
| Taxpayer money recovered | A fraction |

- If a company receives 3 billion in non-recoverable aid and then posts a 200 million profit, the "success" is relative.
- Portugal's Court of Auditors (Tribunal de Contas) has already warned that full recovery of the investment is "implausible."

### The Bottom Line

Presenting the profit without mentioning the capital injection is like saying you saved money on lunch after spending a fortune buying the restaurant.

The profit exists. But the claim that this proves public management works ignores the 3.2 billion euros it took to get there — money that Portuguese taxpayers will not see again.

**TAP's annual reports are public. The European Commission's state aid decision is public. The numbers speak for themselves.**
