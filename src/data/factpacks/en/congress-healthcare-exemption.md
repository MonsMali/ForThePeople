## What They Are Saying

A widely shared claim states that members of Congress "exempted themselves" from the Affordable Care Act, meaning they don't have to follow the same healthcare rules they imposed on everyone else. This claim appears in various forms across social media and chain messages, and has persisted since 2010.

**The frustration behind this is real.** The idea that lawmakers create rules for citizens but not for themselves is genuinely infuriating. If it were true, it would be a serious abuse of power.

But let's look at what the law actually says.

## What The Documents Show

### The Actual Law

Section 1312(d)(3)(D) of the Affordable Care Act contains an unusual provision called the "Congressional Coverage Requirement." It states:

| What the law says | What it means |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Members of Congress and designated staff "shall" obtain coverage through ACA exchanges | Congress is **required** to use the same marketplace as everyone else |
| This applies regardless of other coverage options | They can't opt out by using a different government plan |

This provision was actually an **amendment** introduced by Senator Chuck Grassley specifically to ensure Congress couldn't exempt themselves.

### The Confusion

The confusion stems from a 2013 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) ruling that allowed the federal government to continue contributing to Congressional staff health premiums — similar to how any large employer contributes to employee health plans.

This is not an "exemption." It is the standard employer contribution that most workers with employer-sponsored insurance receive.

### Why This Claim Persists

This is a textbook case of a **zombie claim** — a falsehood that has been debunked repeatedly but keeps returning because:

1. It confirms a pre-existing belief (politicians are self-serving)
2. The real law is complicated enough that the simple lie is easier to share
3. People who share it rarely check the actual text of the law
4. It sounds exactly like something Congress *would* do

**The manipulation isn't by Congress in this case — it's by whoever keeps sharing this debunked claim.** Every time you share it, you're doing their work for free.

### The Bottom Line

Congress is **required by law** to obtain healthcare through the ACA exchanges. Section 1312(d)(3)(D) was written specifically to prevent the exemption that social media claims exists.

**Read the law. It's public. Section 1312(d)(3)(D). The exemption doesn't exist.**
